I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Zynga where I work on shared client SDKs, a package management system for distributing SDKs across games, and do lots of recruiting/extracurriculars on the side (Read: Recruiting more women & diversity, play trombone, do mentorship). 
In my spare time, I lift weights (145lb squat), bake, play trombone, take photos of succulents, play, and make games.

## How I got started
When I was 4, I had my first computer on which I played [Kid Pix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Pix) with my little sister. 
In middle school, I took a flash and web design class with a super funny and smart teacher, Mrs. Bly. 
Meanwhile, I blogged, built websites, and played a lot of [Neopets](http://www.neopets.com/) with my friend, Claire, until our accounts got frozen from talking about _Grey's Anatomy_ in chat.

In high school, I applied to UC Berkeley with the intention of majoring in Economics only, until later that year, I played a game called Portal, which changed my life.

The moment I finished playing Portal, I decided that I wanted to make games. 
I majored in Computer Science (and Economics too!), made lots of games, friends, and learned a lot.
