## About Me
I'm a Senior Software eEgineer working as TL NLU for [Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/).

At Google, I worked on YouTube Trust & Safety doing large scale data migrations and building new tools for reviewing content. 

I also worked at Google Research on a research driven product called Falken, a developer service that allows game developers to train AI to play their games quickly. We published an [Google AI Blog Post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/06/quickly-training-game-playing-agents.html) and an [OSS Project](https://github.com/google-research/falken). 
I've also prepared a talk about this topic so please reach out to me for any speaker opportunities.

Before Google, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Zynga where I developed shared client SDKs, a package management system for distributing SDKs across games, and did lots of recruiting/extracurriculars on the side.

In my spare time, I lift weights, bake, [play trombone](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE2A2A84B881965EC), take photos of [succulents](https://www.instagram.com/sakazaki_succulents/), play [games](https://hinasakazaki.com/tags/reviews/), and make [games](https://hinasakazaki.com/tags/games/).

### How I got started
When I was 4, I had my first computer on which I played [Kid Pix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Pix) with my little sister. 

In middle school, I took a flash and web design class, which exposed me to the joy of creating things that move on its own on the screen.

Meanwhile, I blogged, built websites, and played a lot of [Neopets](https://www.neopets.com/) with my friend, Claire, until our accounts got frozen from talking about _Grey's Anatomy_ in chat.

In high school, I applied to UC Berkeley with the intention of majoring in Economics only, until later that year, I played a game called Portal, which changed my life.

I decided I wanted to make games like Portal, learned programming, and majored in Computer Science.

### Rika

Rika, or Matsurika, is our cat!

We adopted her at 2 years old from [East Bay SPCA](https://eastbayspca.org/) after she gave birth to 6 kittens.
