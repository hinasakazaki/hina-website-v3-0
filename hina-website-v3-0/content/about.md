## About Me
I'm a software engineer at Google working on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) with the mission of making YouTube a safer place.
<br>
<br>
Formerly, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Zynga where I work on shared client SDKs, a package management system for distributing SDKs across games, and do lots of recruiting/extracurriculars on the side.
<br>
<br>
In my spare time, I lift weights (150lb squat), bake, play trombone, take photos of [succulents](https://www.instagram.com/sakazaki_succulents/), play [games](http://hinasakazaki.com/tags/reviews/), and make [games](http://hinasakazaki.com/tags/games/).

### How I got started
When I was 4, I had my first computer on which I played [Kid Pix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Pix) with my little sister. 
<br>
In middle school, I took a flash and web design class, which exposed me to the joy of creating things that move on its own on the screen.
<br>
Meanwhile, I blogged, built websites, and played a lot of [Neopets](http://www.neopets.com/) with my friend, Claire, until our accounts got frozen from talking about _Grey's Anatomy_ in chat.
<br>
<br>
In high school, I applied to UC Berkeley with the intention of majoring in Economics only, until later that year, I played a game called Portal, which changed my life.
<br>
<br>
After playing Portal, I decided I wanted to make games. 
<br>
I majored in Computer Science, where for the first 3.5 years, I struggled a lot, but made a lot of friends.
<br>
For the last semester, I made a lot of games and had lots of fun.

### Side Projects
My most recent side project is [Every Day the Game](https://github.com/hinasakazaki/EveryDayTheGame) which was released September 2017.

I documented a lot of my learnings and process in the github repo.

Aside from my proposal game, I like making "cute with a twist" games that explores darker, uglier sides of humanity through cute, bright colored visuals.
