I had a great 2 year and 10 months of incredible learning & fun at Zynga, but in November, I decided that it was a good time to look for a new opportunity.

In this blog post, I'd like to talk about my process/strategy for switching jobs a few years out of college.

# When is a good time?

When I told my mentor "The average tenure of a new grad software engineer in SF is apparently like 2 years," he responded by saying, "Well, that's for average people. We're not average."
<br>
<br>
Everyone has different things they look for in a job. For me, it was the following things (ranked in order):

- Experience/expertise in my field
- Working with smart and passionate people
- Recognition and growth
- Work life balance
- Market rate salary

When I got out of college, I wanted to work on games. When I joined Zynga, in the first two years, I was able to interact with the code base of a diverse array of games and tech stacks. 
<br>
<br>
I learned from my esteemed game industry veteran mentors. I learned a lot about building APIs, client SDKs, ads, and package management software. And though I wasn't working on graphics optimization or coding game features, I could learn about these fields from experienced devs if I wanted to. 
<br>
<br>
I was able to get a lot of recognition from Zynga, including two company awards and having ownership of important tech used across the company. I was even able to contribute to the Women At Zynga board, and start a Women Engineers @ Zynga group. The people at Zynga were kind and made sure that my impact was recognized. It was extremely rewarding for me to have this level of impact two years out of college. 
<br>
<br?
So why did I leave? 
<br>
<br>
It was around fall when I felt like I was hitting a plateau in my interest and growth. By this time, I had spent close to a year as a tech lead of a team of 5 engineers for the same tech. I had gotten my promotion in the summer and I felt like I was in a really good place. I was in a "proving" mode for the first two years of my career, where I constantly tried to prove that I went above and beyond in my core work. After my promotion, I tried to identify my shortcomings and tackle it - going deep rather than fast, quality over quantity, and being able to give more technical direction to my team. 
<br>
<br>
This period was really good for me to understand myself and what I wanted for the future. I also felt like that it was a good time to go. 
With all of the experience and recognition I got at Zynga, **I felt my resume was in a really great place.** 
<br>


# High Level Planning

At Zynga, I was able to build up my network and work with people who then went to work at other companies.
<br>
I also received quite a bit of recruiting mail as many Silicon Valley engineers do.
<br>
<br>
From this, I created a spreadsheet of opportunities where I listed about 15 companies with fields for:\

- Contact person - whether it be a person to refer me or a recruiter
- Status/Next steps
- Website
- Location
- Priority

<br>
As for the priority, I wanted to have P1 companies, P2 companies to apply to in phases, so I don't run out of choices.
<br>
<br>

Then, I laid out rough milestones:
<br>  

Month      | Tasks
--------------|------
November| Study
December| Study
January| Apply to P1 companies, study
February| Interview at P1 companies, apply to P2 companies
March| Interview at P2 companies, take trip to Japan & Korea
April| Make decision
