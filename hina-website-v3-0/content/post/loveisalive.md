This is a game I submitted for LD46 game jam.

First, a .gif to start off things...

In the midst of shelter-in-home, I've been watching a reality show called _Love is Blind_ like many other consumers.
In addition to that, I've been watching "Couples Therapist Reacts to Love is Blind" on YouTube and it's been surprisingly insightful! [link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRot2oCPvjI) 

Having been shut in with my spouse for over a month now, I am increasingly thankful for vulnerable moments, and aware of walls that we put up when we are unhappy.

This game is a playful take on what I guess some couples therapists do in their job -- sort through anger, defenses, and find the true emotions and make sure there's two way communication.

In addition, I just wanted to experiment with procedurally generated maps, so that's what this ended up being. Just a one screen game about a couples therapy session. 

I didn't have too much time to polish up the letters, so you might find it not perfect -- but if you had watched _Love Is Blind_, I think you might recognize some of the sentiments!

Tech wise, it was pretty straightforward. The most fun part was implementing A* path finding.
